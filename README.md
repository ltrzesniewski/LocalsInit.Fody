This is an add-in for [Fody](https://github.com/Fody/Fody) which lets you control the value of the `localsinit` flag on methods.

There is a [compiler feature proposal](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/master/proposals/skip-localsinit.md) with the same goal. It will replace this weaver if it ever ships.

This is a work in progress.
